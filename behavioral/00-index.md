## 🎯 Why Behavioral Interviews Matter

Behavioral interviews assess:
- **Culture Fit**: How you align with company values
- **Past Performance**: Past behavior predicts future behavior
- **Soft Skills**: Communication, leadership, conflict resolution
- **Self-Awareness**: How you learn from failures and challenges

Most companies allocate **30-50%** of interview time to behavioral rounds.
