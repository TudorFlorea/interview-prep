- **Save**: The most important ones for hiring manager/final rounds

### Matching Questions to Interviewers

| Interviewer Type | Best Questions | Avoid |
|------------------|---------------|-------|

---

## ⚠️ Questions to Avoid

### ❌ Red Flags

**DON'T Ask**:
- "What does your company do?" (Shows you didn't research)
- "How much PTO do I get?" (First interview is too early)
- "Can I work from home?" (Ask after offer, or if remote is standard)
- "How soon can I get promoted?" (Sounds entitled)
- "Do you do background checks?" (Raises concerns)
- "When can I leave early?" (Shows lack of commitment)
- Questions already answered on their website or in the job description

### ⚠️ Timing Matters

**Save for Later** (after you have an offer):
- Compensation details
- Specific PTO/benefits questions
- Remote work policies (unless fully remote company)
- Start date flexibility
- Negotiation topics

**First Interview (Recruiter Screen)**:
- Process and timeline questions
- High-level role questions
- Team structure basics

**Technical Rounds**:
- Technical practices and stack
- Day-to-day work
- Team collaboration

**Final Round (Hiring Manager/Leadership)**:
- Strategic questions
- Growth opportunities
- Company direction

## 💡 Making Your Questions Stand Out

### 1. Build on the Conversation

**Weak**:
> "What's the tech stack?"

**Strong**:
> "You mentioned earlier that the team is working on real-time features. How are you handling the state synchronization challenges? Are you using websockets, or something like CRDTs?"

### 2. Show You've Done Research

**Weak**:
> "What's your product?"

**Strong**:
> "I read your engineering blog post about migrating to microservices. Now that you're 6 months in, what's been the most surprising benefit or challenge of that migration?"

### 3. Demonstrate Strategic Thinking

**Weak**:
> "What will I work on?"

**Strong**:
> "Given that the company is focusing on enterprise clients in 2026, how is the team balancing building enterprise features with maintaining the self-serve product that got you here?"

### 4. Ask Follow-Up Questions

Don't just check boxes—engage in dialogue:

**Initial**: "What's the team's biggest challenge?"

**Follow-up**: "How long has that been a challenge? What's prevented solving it so far?"

---

## 🎭 Practice Techniques

### 1. Prepare Question Clusters

Group related questions you can ask based on the conversation:

**If they mention rapid growth**:
- How is the team scaling?
- What processes are you putting in place?
- How do you maintain quality during fast growth?

**If they mention technical debt**:
- How does the team prioritize paying it down?
- What's your approach to balancing new features and tech debt?
- Can you share an example of a recent refactoring project?

### 2. Natural Delivery

- Don't read from a list
- Weave questions into natural conversation
- React to what they're saying
- Show genuine curiosity, not just checking boxes

### 3. Take Notes

- Write down interesting points during their answers
- Shows you're engaged and taking this seriously
- Helps you remember key information for later rounds
- Enables thoughtful follow-up questions
