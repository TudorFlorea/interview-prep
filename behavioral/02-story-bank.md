## 📋 How to Use This Template

This is YOUR personal story bank. Fill it out with real experiences from your career, mapping each story to common behavioral themes. A single story can often be reused for multiple questions by emphasizing different aspects.

**Goal**: Document 10-15 unique stories that cover all major themes. Each story should:
- Use the [STAR Method](/behavioral/01-star-method.md) framework
- Include quantifiable results
- Cross-reference technical topics where relevant
- Be recent (last 2-3 years preferred)

**Cross-Reference Format**: When stories involve technical decisions, link to relevant prep materials:
- Database decisions → [databases/](/databases/00-index.md)
- System architecture → [system-design/fundamentals/](/system-design/fundamentals/00-index.md)
- Design patterns → [design-patterns/](/design-patterns/00-index.md)
- Algorithm choices → [dsa/](/dsa/00-index.md)

## 📚 Example: Completed Story

### Story #1: Database Performance Crisis

**Primary Theme**: Technical Decision Making, Problem-Solving

**Secondary Themes**: Time Management, Data-Driven Decisions

**Timeline**: August 2025

**Company/Project**: E-commerce Platform at TechCorp

#### Situation
Our e-commerce platform was experiencing 30% cart abandonment during checkout due to slow load times, particularly during peak hours. This was costing us approximately $500K in lost revenue per quarter. We had 3 weeks until Black Friday, our highest-traffic period, making this critical to resolve.

#### Task
As the senior backend engineer, I was tasked with identifying the bottleneck and reducing page load time to under 2 seconds while maintaining system stability during our busiest season.

#### Action
First, I profiled the application using New Relic and identified that 80% of the latency came from N+1 database queries in the product recommendation engine—we were making 200+ individual database calls per page load. I analyzed our query patterns and consulted our database normalization design to understand the relationship structure.

I designed a solution using Redis caching for product data with a 5-minute TTL and implemented eager loading for related entities to eliminate N+1 queries. Working with the DBA, I added composite indexes on our most frequent query paths, specifically on (category_id, price, rating) which covered 70% of our queries.

Before deploying to production, I created a performance test suite using JMeter to validate the improvements under simulated Black Friday load. I gradually rolled out the changes using feature flags over 3 days, monitoring error rates and latency at each step to ensure we didn't introduce regressions.

#### Result
The changes reduced average page load time from 8 seconds to 1.2 seconds—an 85% improvement. Cart abandonment dropped from 30% to 12% within two weeks, translating to an additional $1.8M in quarterly revenue. The error rate remained stable at 0.02% throughout the rollout, and we handled Black Friday traffic (3x normal volume) without incident.

The performance test suite I created became the standard for all backend teams, and the caching patterns I implemented were adopted across five other services. This experience taught me the importance of profiling before optimizing and the value of gradual rollouts for critical changes.

#### Technical Cross-References
- Related prep topics:
  - [Database Indexing](/databases/07-indexing-deep-dive.md) - Composite indexes
  - [Query Optimization](/databases/09-query-optimization.md) - N+1 query patterns
  - [Caching Strategies](/system-design/fundamentals/05-caching.md) - Redis TTL patterns
  - [Performance Tuning](/databases/10-performance-tuning.md) - Profiling approaches
- Technologies: Redis, PostgreSQL, New Relic, JMeter, C# Entity Framework, Feature Flags

#### Variations
- **For Leadership questions**: Emphasize working with DBA, establishing new standards for team
- **For Technical questions**: Deep dive into N+1 problem, indexing strategy, caching tradeoffs
- **For Time Management questions**: Focus on 3-week deadline, phased rollout strategy

#### Key Talking Points
- 📊 Metrics: 85% latency reduction, $1.8M revenue impact, 3x Black Friday traffic handled
- 💡 Insight: Profile first, optimize second; gradual rollouts reduce risk
- 🚀 Impact: Testing suite and caching patterns adopted across 5+ services
