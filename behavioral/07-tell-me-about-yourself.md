## 📋 Why This Question Matters

"Tell me about yourself" is typically the first question in behavioral interviews. It:
- Sets the tone for the entire conversation
- Gives you control over the narrative
- Highlights what you want the interviewer to remember
- Demonstrates communication skills

**Critical**: This is NOT your life story. It's a strategic career narrative.

## 💡 Complete Examples

### Example 1: Mid-Level Backend Engineer → Senior Engineer at FAANG

> "I'm a Backend Engineer at TechCorp, an e-commerce platform serving 5 million monthly users. I focus on our core API infrastructure and recently led a performance optimization initiative that reduced P95 latency by 70% and saved $300K annually in infrastructure costs.
>
> Before TechCorp, I spent 2 years at StartupCo building their initial API from the ground up, which taught me how to make pragmatic architectural decisions with limited resources. I started my career at ConsultingCo doing full-stack development, which gave me great exposure to client communication and business requirements.
>
> I'm excited about Amazon because the scale challenges you face—billions of requests daily—are the next level of complexity I want to tackle. The distributed systems problems in AWS services particularly interest me, and I'm eager to learn from teams who've solved these problems at unprecedented scale. My experience optimizing high-traffic systems and working cross-functionally would let me contribute from day one."

**Time**: ~2 minutes  
**Strengths**: Specific metrics, clear progression, company-specific interest

### Example 2: Tech Lead → Engineering Manager

> "I'm a Tech Lead at DataCorp, managing a team of 6 engineers building real-time analytics infrastructure processing 500K events per second. Beyond the technical architecture, I spend significant time mentoring my team—in the past year, I've helped promote 2 engineers to senior level and coached 3 others through challenging projects.
>
> I've been at DataCorp for 4 years, starting as a Senior Engineer before transitioning into the tech lead role 18 months ago. That progression taught me there's a big difference between being a strong individual contributor and enabling a whole team to succeed. Before DataCorp, I spent 3 years at AdTech building data pipelines, which gave me the distributed systems foundation I use today.
>
> I'm interested in transitioning fully into engineering management because I've discovered I get more satisfaction from growing engineers and removing blockers than from writing code myself. Microsoft's focus on growth mindset and developing people resonates deeply with my leadership style. I'm particularly excited about this role because it would let me build a team from the ground up while contributing to Azure's infrastructure initiatives."

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. The Chronological Resume Recitation
**Bad**:
> "I graduated in 2015, then I worked at Company A for 2 years doing X, then Company B for 3 years doing Y, then Company C..."

**Why It's Bad**: Boring, no narrative, sounds like reading your resume

**Fix**: Focus on themes and growth, not chronology

---

### 2. The Life Story
**Bad**:
> "I grew up in Ohio, went to State University where I majored in CS because I liked video games, had an internship at..."

**Why It's Bad**: Too much irrelevant detail, wastes time

**Fix**: Start with current role and work backwards selectively

---

### 3. The Technology List
**Bad**:
> "I know Python, Java, JavaScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS..."

**Why It's Bad**: No context, doesn't show what you've actually built

**Fix**: Mention technologies in context of what you built with them

---

### 4. The Generic Answer
**Bad**:
> "I'm interested in your company because you do cool work with great people and I want to grow my career."

**Why It's Bad**: Could apply to any company, shows no research

**Fix**: Mention something specific about the company or role

---

### 5. Talking Too Long
**Bad**: 5+ minute monologue covering every detail

**Why It's Bad**: Loses interviewer's attention, eats interview time

**Fix**: Practice and time yourself—aim for 2-3 minutes

---

### 6. Being Too Humble
**Bad**:
> "I'm just a regular engineer doing normal work. I contribute to projects like everyone else."

**Why It's Bad**: Doesn't give interviewer anything to get excited about

**Fix**: Be specific about your impact without false modesty

---

### 7. Negativity About Current/Past Roles
**Bad**:
> "I'm looking to leave because my current company has terrible management and the code is a mess..."

**Why It's Bad**: Raises concerns you'll speak negatively about them next

**Fix**: Frame positively—focus on what you're looking for, not what you're escaping

## 🎭 Practice Techniques

### 1. Write It Out First
- Draft your full answer (aim for ~300-400 words)
- Read it out loud—does it sound natural?
- Time yourself reading it
- Revise until it flows naturally

### 2. Record Yourself
- Video or audio record your answer
- Watch/listen for:
  - Filler words (um, uh, like)
  - Pacing (too fast?)
  - Energy (enthusiastic?)
  - Body language (if video)

### 3. Get Feedback
- Practice with a friend or mentor
- Ask them:
  - What stood out to you?
  - What would you remember about me?
  - Did I talk too long?
  - Did any part confuse you?

### 4. Memorize Structure, Not Script
- Don't memorize word-for-word (sounds robotic)
- Memorize:
  - Key points in each section
  - Specific metrics
  - Transitions between sections
- Let the exact words vary each time

### 5. Practice Different Versions
- 2-minute version (standard)
- 1-minute version (if interrupted or time-constrained)
- 3-minute version (if they seem very interested)
