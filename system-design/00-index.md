## 🎯 How to Use This Guide

### For Interview Preparation
1. **Start with fundamentals** - Ensure you understand the building blocks
2. **Practice the framework** - Use the RESHADED approach consistently
3. **Do problems in order** - Easier problems build intuition for harder ones
4. **Time yourself** - Real interviews are 45-60 minutes
5. **Explain out loud** - Practice articulating your thought process

### For Each Problem
1. **Requirements first** - Spend 5 minutes clarifying scope
2. **API and data model** - Define your contract early
3. **Start simple** - Get a working design, then iterate
4. **Deep dive on 2-3 areas** - Show depth, not just breadth
5. **Discuss tradeoffs** - Every decision has pros and cons

### The RESHADED Framework
A systematic approach to system design interviews:

| Letter | Phase | Time |
|--------|-------|------|
| **R** | Requirements | 5 min |
| **E** | Entities (Data Model) | 2 min |
| **S** | System API | 5 min |
| **H** | High-Level Design | 10-15 min |
| **A** | Articulate Deep Dives | 10 min |
| **D** | Design Decisions | Throughout |
| **E** | Edge Cases | 5 min |
| **D** | Discuss Bottlenecks | 5 min |
